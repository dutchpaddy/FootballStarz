About: FOOTBALLSTARZ

FootballStarz is an ASP.NET Core MVC web application.
Its purpose is to have a toy project to try out and experiment webdevelopment.


FootballStarz evolves around 3 major entities:
1. Stadiums, home of
2. Clubs, that contract
3. Players to play for them

Simple as that.

Functions on these entities are:
1. Create them
2. Update (Edit) them,
3. Delete them.
4. Show their Details

CRUD, so to speak.

As FootballStarz is based on .Net, running in ASP.Net Core, it is OS independent.

The development was started on a Windows 10 box, up to December 2020.
From that month on the development was migrated to a MacOS 11 Big Sur machine and continued.
All without a single change in code ! (only the appsettings.json was updated for database connection).

After migration of the database the app is up and running perfectly.

HAIL BILL!
